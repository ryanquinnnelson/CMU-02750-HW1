Spring 2021 Active Learning Project for Automation of Scientific Research

This project explores basic Active Learning algorithms (Random Sampling, Uncertainty Sampling, Density-based Sampling,  Query-by-Committee) as implemented in the python library modAL. The project also implements an Importance Weighted Active Learning (IWAL) algorithm from scratch.

### Project Structure
The IWAL algorithm is implemented as a testable Python package `iwal` and is found under /packages.
